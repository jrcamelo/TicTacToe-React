# Simple Tic Tac Toe game with React and TypeScript

This is a very short tic tac toe game made with React and TS for learning purposes. 
It was made by following a [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) step-by-step instruction with some deliberate changes. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
